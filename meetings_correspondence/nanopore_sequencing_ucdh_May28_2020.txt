Johnathan Eisen and David Coil Zoom Meeting May 28, 2020 3-3:30pm

Full time bioinformatician leaving. They’re happy with Genomes: Phylogenomics, alignments, etc.

However, QC, Polishing data, reference etc. might be better handled by me for now 

Initial indications: Illumina data was crap. Shotgun. Tiling reads from total RNA > cDNA to the Wuhan reference. Very low success.  Small portion of the genome from the lowest Ct

Chris Mason has tried, amplicon, shotgun, Illumina and Nanopore. Default is shotgun Illumina. 

We want to be able to determine: It is close to the patient genome, or not, or to the patient sample.

Will error rate of Nanopore be hinderance to inferring these relationships?

Genomes from a few of the samples and then compare  

Get the one genome we have and do the alignment.

By the end of next week all the materials should be at the UCD Hospital

Week after that will be sampling.

Then RNA/RT-PCR the following week, so looking at 3 weeks more or less

Check in with Chris Miller on Joe De Risi’s genomes and how they’re sequencing (Johnathan will follow up.
