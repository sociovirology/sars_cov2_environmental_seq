Lab supplies 10-1-20 

Nanopore: 
- The SQT reagent might be a little low, depending on the volumes used. There are 2 tubes, both have some volume. 
-Nothing else is low, I combined all reagents into 1 box that I labelled as "Extra Reagents". 
-Flow Cell Priming kits are not really running low. There are 2 kits, one mostly full, the other a quarter full. 


Water: 
- Is there any unopened nuclease-free water? I would like to make some smaller aliquots from a fresh bottle so I can better control for potential contamination. 

Tips:
-Are the type of filter tips used in the flu interchangeable with those in the main lab? If so, nothing is running low. If flu room has special filter tips then those are running a bit low: 
- 9 boxes p10
- 6 boxes p200
- 6 boxes p1000

Gloves:
- the blue nitrile gloves may be running a bit low, there are a few boxes on the upper shelf  of each size but if that is all there is then we'll be running low soonish. 

Competent cells etc:
-Do we have competent cells in the lab that I can use to increase the plasmid stocks we were sent? Do you know what antibiotic resistance they have? I'll have a look around for supplies for making media and plates too. 

-SARS-CoV2 Sequencing Protocol Troubleshoot-

- I am getting low concentrations on all my samples, so I want to troubleshoot why. Can I Qubit the cDNA with same reagents as for dsDNA?
- (In this case low concentration = ~ 0.16 - 1.0 ng/ul for samples post PCR, before pooling)

- I noticed in your notes from your run through of the protocol, you used 2ul post PCR to Qubit, whereas the protocol says to run 1ul. Is 1ul too little to get an accurate reading?

- Could I be using incorrect reagents at the PCR step? I ask because my concentrations for the 3 plasmid positive controls were also very low- same range as products from the cDNA samples, which does not seem right. I should check I am using the correct dNTPS, since all other reagents are straight from the NEB Q5 kit. I should run a PCR just with the plasmids & check on a gel maybe.
