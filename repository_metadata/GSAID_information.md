## Samples Selected for GSAID Upload
Included two near-complete genomes from samples originally labelled 27 and 51. Using these particular genomes below:  

barcode sample run run_barcode Location Object.Surface Date.collected mean_ct uncalled_bases  minimum_fold_coverage called_bases percent_called
barcode05	27	run2	run2_barcode05	Patient room D14	Floor	4/25/2020	36.4983333333333	294	5	29608	99.016788
barcode18	51	run2	run2_barcode18	Patient room T7 Blue	soiled linen lid	4/25/2020	36.885	2468	5	27434	91.746371

Those correspond to the following FASTA files:
Sample 27, run2_barcode05, Patient room D14, Floor: ncov_ucdh_env1_run2/barcode05/sample_barcode05.consensus.fasta
Sample 51, run2_barcode18, Patient room T7 Blue,	soiled linen lid: ncov_ucdh_env1_run2/barcode18/sample_barcode18.consensus_5X.fasta

Note, sample 27 was run again on Run 5, but as a control, at that point cDNA had been freeze-thawed a couple of time. So using Run 2 as the definitive sample.

For upload, used file as is, I believe GSAID will modify the headers.
